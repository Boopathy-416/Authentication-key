1️⃣ Backend Setup (Node.js + Express + MongoDB + JWT)
Step 1: Install Dependencies
Set up an Express.js server and install required packages:

express → Backend framework

mongoose → Connects MongoDB

dotenv → Manages environment variables

bcryptjs → Hashes passwords

jsonwebtoken (JWT) → Handles authentication tokens

cors → Enables Cross-Origin requests

cookie-parser → Manages cookies for authentication

Step 2: Connect to MongoDB
Use mongoose to establish a database connection.

Store database credentials in .env.

Step 3: Create User Model
Define a User Schema with fields like name, email, password.

Ensure password hashing with bcryptjs before saving users.

Step 4: Implement Authentication Routes
Signup → Creates a new user, hashes password, and stores it in MongoDB.

Login → Verifies user credentials, generates a JWT, and stores it in cookies.

Logout → Clears authentication cookies.

Protected Routes → Middleware to restrict access based on valid tokens.

Step 5: Secure Routes with JWT Middleware
A middleware function extracts and verifies the JWT token from cookies.

Only authenticated users can access protected routes.

2️⃣ Frontend Setup (React + Vite + Context API)
Step 1: Install Dependencies
react-router-dom → Enables navigation between pages.

react-hook-form & zod → Handles form validation.

jwt-decode → Decodes JWT tokens.

axios → Handles API requests.

Step 2: Create Authentication Context (Global State Management)
Manages user state and authentication across the app.

Provides functions for signup, login, and logout.

Stores the JWT token securely in cookies.

Step 3: Implement Login & Signup Pages
Login Page

Takes email & password input.

Sends login request to backend.

Stores authentication token in cookies.

Redirects to dashboard upon success.

Signup Page

Takes name, email, and password.

Hashes password before storing it.

Automatically logs in the user after signup.

Step 4: Protect Routes with Authentication Middleware
Restrict access to certain pages (e.g., Dashboard) unless user is logged in.

Redirect unauthenticated users to the Login page.

Step 5: Implement Logout Functionality
Clear cookies and reset the user state.

Redirect to the login page after logout.
